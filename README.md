# Indilatory

This is the sample application and unit test bucket for [ddd-associations](https://github.com/nerab/ddd-associations), an implementation of object associations (like [ActiveRecord](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html)) that does not require any persistence layer to correctly model the object associations.

# What about the name?
Indilatory is a play on the word dilatory, which [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilatory_motions_and_tactics) describes as "are those [tactics or motions] used to delay or obstruct business". In a [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd) sense, the application encourages behavior that is /not/ dilatory, and thus helps preventing [procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination).
